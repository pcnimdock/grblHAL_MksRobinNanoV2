## Assorted small plugins

### Probe relay(s)

Adds setting `$678` \(toolsetter\) and `$679` \(secondary probe\) for which auxiliary ports to use for controlling the probe selection relay(s). Set to `-1` when unused/disabled.  
Probe selection is via the inbuilt `G65P5Q<n>` macro, `<n>` is the probe id: 0 - primary probe, 1 - toolsetter, 2 - secondary probe.
The toolsetter can be selected automatically on "@G59.3" toolchanges.

Dependencies:

The selected driver/board must provide at least one free auxiliary digital output port capable of driving the relay coil, either directly or via a buffer.

### Feed override

Adds Marlin style [M220](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M220.html) command for setting feed overrides.

```
  M220 [B] [R] [S<percent>]

  B - backup current values
  R - restore values from backup
  S<percent> - percentage of current feedrate.
```
> [!NOTE]
> `M220RS<percentage>` can be used to override the rapids rate, if R is not specified the feed rate will be overridden. This deviates from the Marlin specification.

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define FEED_OVERRIDE_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_.

### Homing pulloff

*** Experimental ***

Adds per axis setting for homing pulloff distance. `$290` for X-axis pulloff, `$291` for Y-axis, ...

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define HOMING_PULLOFF_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_.

### ESP-AT

*** Experimental ***

Adds Telnet support via [ESP-AT](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/esp32/Get_Started/index.html) running on a supported ESP MCU.
Allows senders to connect to the controller via WiFi.

Dependencies:

Driver and board support for a serial port \(UART\) that is not claimed by a different plugin.

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define ESP_AT_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_.

Adds many networking and WiFi settings for configuring mode \(Station, Access Point\), Telnet port, IP adress etc.

> [!NOTE]
> The ESP32 is a 3.3V device and pins are not 5V tolerant. If the controller serial port uses 5V signalling add a 5V to 3.3V level shifter, at least for the controller TX line.

### FluidNC I/O Expander

*** Experimental ***

Adds up to 8 external digital inputs and up to 10 external digital outputs usable via `M62`-`M66` and claimable by plugin code.  
A single on/off style RGB LED is also supported. This can be controlled via`M150` if the _RGB LED strip control_ plugin is enabled.

Dependencies:

Driver and board support for a serial port \(UART\) that is not claimed by a different plugin.
It implements the [FluidNC Channel I/O protocol](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/config/uart_sections#channel-io).   
Firmware is available for STM32-based breakout boards such as cheap STM32F103 based Red/Bluepills or the ready-made [Airedale I/O Expander](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/hardware/official/airedale) board.
A second source of this design is made by [PiBot](https://www.pibot.com/cnc-laser-electronics/pibot-stm32-io-expander-for-fluidnc-v4).  
The plugin can also be used with the Raspberry [Pico implementation](https://github.com/grblHAL/RP_FNC_IO_Expander) of the protocol, with the W versions passthrough can even be routed to BlueTooth. 

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define FNC_EXPANDER_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_.

> [!NOTE]
> Analog output \(PWM\) is currently not supported - may be added later.

### RGB LED strip control

Adds support for Marlin style [M150 command](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M150.html).

```
M150 [B<intensity>] [I<pixel>] [K] [S<strip>] [P<intensity>] [R<intensity>] [B<intensity>] [U<intensity>] [W<intensity>]

    B<intensity> - blue component, 0 - 255.
    I<pixel>     - LED index, 0 - 255. Available if number of LEDs in strip is > 1.
    K            - keep unspecified values.
    P<intensity> - brightness, 0 - 255.
    S<strip>     - strip index, 0 or 1. Default is 0.
    R<intensity> - red component, 0 - 255.
    U<intensity> - green component, 0 - 255.
```

Dependencies:

Driver and board support for LED strips or a single on/off style RGB LED.

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define RGB_LED_ENABLE` in _my_machine.h_ and set/change the define value to `2`.

Dependencies:

Driver and board support for LED strips.  
> [!NOTE]
> If B axis is enabled then the plugin will not be activated.

### Bind events to aux output ports

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define EVENTOUT_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_ .

Depending on the number of free output ports up to four events can be selected.
Settings `$750+<n>` is used to select the event \(trigger\) to bind to the port selected by setting `$760+<n>`
where `<n>` is the event number, currently 0 - 3.

Dependencies:

The selected driver/board must provide at least one free auxiliary output port.

### File based tooltable

*** Experimental ***

Adds support for [LinuxCNC format tool table](https://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/devel/html/gcode/tool-compensation.html#sub:tool-table-format) loaded from root file system \(SD card\).

The plugin allows mapping of tools to tool rack/carousel pockets, planned is support for randomized toolchangers.

The file _/linuxcnc/tooltable.tbl_ is used for storing the tool table and it is automatically loaded when the SD card is mounted.

Configuration:

Add/uncomment `#define TOOLTABLE_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_.

Dependencies:

[SD card](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_SD_card/) plugin.

### PWM Servo

*** Experimental ***

```
M280 [P<index>] [S<position>]

    P<index>    - servo to set or get position for. Default is 0.
    S<position> - set position in degrees, 0 - 180.
                  If omitted the current position is reported: 
                  [Servo <index> position: <position> degrees]

```

Configuration:
